	// Since it doesn't see the strings in the definitions directory, that
	// means it would be impossible to provide translations for them if
	// we didn't use this workaround. Don't judge us!

	// TODO: fix a better solution! Maybe patch gotext to have a flag to change
	// this behavior or something else.
